# CaffeineCode_Launcher

Bookmarks are love but what if you can easily access your favourite and daily coding platforms from a single extension. CaffeineCode Launcher does the same. 
Whether it's about curiosity to see changes in your rating, attempting a contest, creating a repo, or developing anything, CaffeineCode Launcher is the handy solution.
You can access Codechef, Codeforces, HackerEarth, HackerRank, Leetcode, Topcoder and Github for now.

What's coming next?
In the upcoming version, one can expect customisation, dark mode and more smooth experience.
